# hospweb
I have made this website theme based on Online Hospital Portal , This is my one of the projects of PW Skills Full Stack Development Course .

I have used almost all types of css in this project ,This website is not responsive I have made the website for big screens.

This website project took me almost one week to design because every single line of code i have written by my own , they were no source code available,

i only got an image of expected output and i have to design the webpage similiar to that , it really helps me to concrete my learning , this website gave me

much self confident than before.
